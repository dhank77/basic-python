# Exercise 36
# Write a function definition named quotient that takes in two numbers and returns only the quotient from dividing the first argument by the second argument.

def quotient(number1, number2) :
    return number1 // number2

assert quotient(27, 9) == 3
assert quotient(5, 2) == 2
assert quotient(10, 3) == 3
print("Exercise 36 is correct.")
