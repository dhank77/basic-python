# Exercise 40
# Write a function definition named area_of_rectangle that takes in two numbers and returns the product.

def area_of_rectangle(number1, number2) :
    return number1 * number2

assert area_of_rectangle(1, 3) == 3
assert area_of_rectangle(5, 2) == 10
assert area_of_rectangle(2, 7) == 14
assert area_of_rectangle(5.3, 10.3) == 54.59
